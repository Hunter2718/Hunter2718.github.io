      <h1>🧠 Competing in a CTF With a University Team…as a High School Student</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>TL;DR</h2>
        <p>I joined my locka University's CTF team as a high school student to compete in TryHackMe’s Industrial Intrusion challenge. I was assigned OSINT flags since I didn’t have full access to THM’s tools. I learned to trust my knowledge and to not overthink. Even with limited tools and experience, I was able to help the team and grow from the experience.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>🧠 How I Got In</h2>
        <p>My local University's team needed one more member to do TryHackMe’s Industrial Intrusion room competitively. I wasn’t in their cyber club (though I’m a concurrent student), but they let me join.</p>
        <p>I had done plenty of CTFs on picoCTF, but this was my first team-based, time-limited competition. I didn’t know what to expect, but I was ready to try something new.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>🎯 My Role on the Team</h2>
        <p>I was assigned the OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) flags — 3 in total. While I usually focus on binary exploitation (my favorite), this room had none of that category. I was happy to contribute however I could.</p>
        <p>Unlike the rest of the team who had THM Premium, I was using a free account, which limited me to one hour per day on the attack box. OSINT didn’t require it — perfect fit.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>🧰 The Tools I Used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>gobuster</strong> — for directory enumeration</li>
          <li><strong>dig</strong> — for DNS record lookups</li>
          <li><strong>lookup.tools/dns</strong> — for fast online DNS and WHOIS</li>
          <li><strong>CyberChef</strong> — for decoding/encoding/transformation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No complex setups — just using what I knew effectively.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>🧩 The Challenges</h2>
        <p>The first OSINT flag was actually the hardest. Not because it was tricky — but because I was overthinking everything. I assumed it had to be deep in DNS or metadata, but it was much simpler.</p>
        <blockquote>
          “Don’t overthink — I’m not in over my head.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>Once I got the first flag, my confidence grew, and I solved the remaining two much more smoothly.</p>

        <h2>💡 What I Learned</h2>
        <p>This wasn’t a technical breakthrough, but a mental one:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Don’t overthink.</strong> Try the simple route first.</li>
          <li><strong>I belonged there.</strong> I was the youngest and least experienced, but I could still compete.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>🔁 What I’d Do Differently</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Become more well-rounded across all CTF categories</li>
          <li>Learn to recognize challenge patterns faster</li>
          <li>Stay calm instead of spiraling into analysis loops</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>🧠 Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>This wasn’t my first CTF, but it was my first team competition. It changed how I think about challenges and what I’m capable of.</p>
        <p>Even with limited access and experience, I was able to help my team and grow. And that’s what matters most.</p>
